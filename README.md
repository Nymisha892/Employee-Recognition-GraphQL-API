This is a complete, enterprise-grade Real-Time Employee Recognition API built from the ground up using a secure-by-design architecture. It features a robust GraphQL interface with queries, mutations, and live updates via WebSockets. Security is paramount, with authentication delegated to an external IdP (like Auth0/Okta) using OAuth 2.0 / OIDC, and a two-layer Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) model to protect data at both the endpoint and record level. The modular design, built with Spring Boot and Spring Security, demonstrates best practices for building scalable, maintainable, and analytics-ready applications.
